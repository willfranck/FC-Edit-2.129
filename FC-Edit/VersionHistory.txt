* Note the new setting (tab 4): IGN vs TPS added for L-Jetro Power-FCs.
  This used to displayed as advance, however some Power-FC owners reported this was actually retard on their Power-FC's, so it seems Apexi did not make this consistant accross the board. The setting is now just labeled displayed as 'Adjust' due to this inconsistancy.
